Recursion is when function cals itself.

// infinite loop
callMe() {
    callMe();
    callMe();
}

We ned to break out of the loop.
One way to do this is to RETURN.
Another is base condition IF statement;
Often forget to return function to preserv calculated value.

Usage:

FACTORIAL
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) return 1;
  return n*factorial(n-1);
}
console.log(factorial(5));

We go down to base case and then bubleup the result.
